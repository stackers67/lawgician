* **System Design**  
  * The system will be a web application.  
  * It will follow a workflow-driven approach, guiding users through case preparation.  
  * The system will consist of a front-end for user interaction and a back-end for data processing and storage.  
  * Document upload, analysis, and report generation will be automated.  
* **Architecture Pattern**  
  * Recommended: Model-View-Controller (MVC) or a variant such as Model-View-Presenter (MVP)  
  * Rationale: MVC provides a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to develop, test, and maintain. This aligns well with the workflow-driven nature of the application.  
* **State Management**  
  * Recommended: A session-based approach with server-side storage.  
  * Rationale: Given the sensitive nature of legal data, this provides better security and control.  
* **Data Flow**  
  1. User uploads case files.  
  2. Files are sent to the back-end for storage and analysis.  
  3. The back-end processes the files (NLP analysis, legal data retrieval).  
  4. The back-end generates a summary and reports.  
  5. The back-end sends the results to the front-end.  
  6. The front-end displays the information to the user.  
* **Technical Stack**  
  * This is where your preferred technologies come in. I need to know what you are comfortable with.  
  * Example:  
    * Front-end: React.js, HTML5, CSS3  
    * Back-end: Node.js, Express.js  
    * Database: PostgreSQL  
    * NLP: Python with NLTK or SpaCy  
* **Authentication Process**  
  * Users will be required to log in to access the application.  
  * Recommended: A standard authentication method (e.g., username/password) with hashing and salting for password storage.  
  * Consider: Two-factor authentication for enhanced security.  
* **Route Design**  
  * Example (using Express.js style):  
    * /login (for user login)  
    * /cases (displays a list of cases)  
    * /cases/:caseId (displays a specific case)  
    * /cases/:caseId/upload (handles document uploads)  
    * /cases/:caseId/report (displays the generated report)  
* **API Design**  
  * Recommended: RESTful API  
  * Example Endpoints:  
    * POST /api/login (authenticate user)  
    * POST /api/cases (create a new case)  
    * GET /api/cases/:caseId (retrieve case details)  
    * POST /api/cases/:caseId/documents (upload documents)  
    * GET /api/cases/:caseId/report (get the report)  
* **Database Design ERD**  
  * (A more detailed ERD would be included here, but I can't generate a visual one in this format. Here's a textual representation of the key entities and relationships)  
  * Entities:  
    * Users: (userId, username, password, firmId)  
    * Firms: (firmId, firmName)  
    * Cases: (caseId, userId, caseName, caseDescription, createdDate)  
    * Documents: (documentId, caseId, documentName, documentPath, uploadDate)  
    * Reports: (reportId, caseId, reportContent, generatedDate)  
  * Relationships:  
    * Users belong to Firms (1:Many)  
    * Users create Cases (1:Many)  
    * Cases have Documents (1:Many)  
    * Cases have Reports (1:1)
